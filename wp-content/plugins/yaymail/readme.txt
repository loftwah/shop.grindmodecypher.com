[Free vs Pro](https://docs.yaycommerce.com/yaymail/compare-yaymail-free-and-pro) | [YayMail Addons](https://yaycommerce.com/yaymail-addons/)


YayMail is a free **WooCommerce email template customizer** with a drag-and-drop interface. When combined with [**YayMail Premium Addons**](https://yaycommerce.com/yaymail-addons/), you will unlock the visual email designer integration to go with 50+ third-party WooCommerce plugins.

With YayMail, you can drag and drop elements to the email templates. Each element makes a block in the WooCommerce visual email editor. And it is very easy to edit content and design email layouts, just like how you do it with the Gutenberg editor or Elementor page builder.

Exclusively, you can also send personalized email templates using shortcodes, placeholders, and WooCommerce conditional logic.

###‚ö°Ô∏è FEATURES

The YayMail free version allows you to add **unlimited elements** to create html email template:

**Custom WooCommerce Email Templates**
Unlike Kadence woocommerce email designer, this email customizer allows you to create extra blocks to add to your email templates to make a unique and memorable brand identity for your store.

**Drag and Drop Interface**
Easy to navigate between the element sidebar and the preview area to customise email block elements.

**Edit Everything**
You can edit content, layout, and design of email header, email body, visual footer, signature, social follow module, and more. It means that all your communication with your customers will¬†finally¬†match the rest of your¬†branding.

**Visual Email Editor**
Design HTML email and live preview on the same screen. Apart from the full window view, you can take a look on desktop and mobile view.

**Powerful Shortcodes**
You have a variety of placeholders for order details, customer details, billing info, shipping, payment, new user info, additional order metadata, etc. Literally, everything you need to establish a strong brand impression!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I customize a WooCommerce email template? =
From YayMail user interface, select an email template from the dropdown list of WooCommerce workflows. For instance, if you've chosen **Completed order** template, you'll get its related sample content loaded in the editing section. Then you will be able to start editing using the custom email blocks.

= How do I change the email content in WooCommerce? =
To change the email content in a WooCommerce email, just select an email element, you will see its text editor on the left panel. From there, you can edit the text, images, and other media content in your emails.

= How do I override WooCommerce email templates? =
With YayMail, you don't have to modify your theme code to override WooCommerce email templates. To stop using the old style email template and start sending the new email design, just go to YayMail and enable the templates you want to use. For example, to override the `customer-completed-order.php` template, just enable **Completed order** email template in the YayMail's dropdown list. 

= YayMail Pro vs. Premium Addon, not sure which to buy? =
No worries, [it doesn't hurt to ask](https://m.me/yaycommerce).

= I have issues when customizing WooCommerce default emails. How can I get support? =
Please [create a topic](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/yaymail/) or [contact us](https://yaycommerce.com/support/) to get help. We‚Äôre sure to resolve the glitch!
To quickly get the answers, please attach screenshots of screen notice and currently activated WooCommerce plugins on your website.

= I can't save my designed templates. What should I do now? =
Please make sure not to add external links or insecure resources to the email template. Then, please try clicking on Reset template to revert it back to the initial design.

= What are the differences between YayMail Free & Pro version? =
Both the free and pro version offer **full customizability**. The sole difference between them lies in the extended compatibility with third-party plugins such as WooCommerce Shipment Tracking, WC Custom Order Status, Custom Fields, etc. 
Considering moving from **YayMail free** to [**premium plan**](https://yaycommerce.com/yaymail-woocommerce-email-customizer/)? 
See here [full comparison](https://docs.yaycommerce.com/yaymail/compare-yaymail-free-and-pro).
