== Description ==

**The best WooCommerce Email Customizer with custom blocks and HTML elements**

[DOCS](https://docs.yaycommerce.com/yaymail/getting-started/introduction) | [YAYMAIL PRO](https://yaycommerce.com/yaymail-woocommerce-email-customizer/) | [YAYMAIL ADDONS](https://yaycommerce.com/yaymail-woocommerce-email-customizer/#yaymail-addon-woo-subscriptions)

YayMail is a free **email template builder** for WooCommerce. When combined with [**YayMail Premium Addons**](https://yaycommerce.com/yaymail-woocommerce-email-customizer/#yaymail-addons), you will unlock the visual email designer integration to go with 50+ third-party WooCommerce plugins.

With YayMail, you can drag and drop elements to the email templates. Each element makes a block in the WooCommerce email editor. And it is very easy to edit content and design email layouts, just like how you do it with the Gutenberg editor or Elementor page builder.

Exclusively, you can also send personalized email templates using WooCommerce conditional logic.

###⚡️ FEATURES

The YayMail free version allows you to add unlimited elements to create html email template:

**Drag and Drop Interface**
Easy to navigate between the element sidebar and the preview area to customise email block elements.

**Edit Everything**
You can edit content, layout, and design of email header, email body, visual footer, signature, social follow module, and more. It means that all your communication with your customers will finally match the rest of your branding.

**Visual Email Editor**
Design HTML email and live preview on the same screen. Apart from the full window view, you can take a look on desktop and mobile view.

**Powerful Shortcodes**
You have a variety of placeholders for order details, customer details, billing info, shipping, payment, new user info, additional order metadata, etc. Literally, everything you need to establish a strong brand impression!

**Send Test Email**
One-click to send a test email template to make sure it looks good on different email clients & devices.

**Fully Customize 11 WooCommerce Order Email Template**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= YayMail Pro vs. Premium Addon, not sure which to buy? =
No worries, [it doesn't hurt to ask](https://m.me/yaycommerce).

= I have issues when customizing WooCommerce default emails. How can I get support? =
Please [create a topic](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/yaymail/) or [contact us](https://yaycommerce.com/support/) to get help. We’re sure to resolve the glitch!
To quickly get the answers, please attach screenshots of screen notice and currently activated WooCommerce plugins on your website.

= What are the differences between YayMail Free & Pro version? =
Both the free and pro version offer **full customizability**. The sole difference between them lies in the extended compatibility with third-party plugins such as WooCommerce Shipment Tracking, WC Custom Order Status, Custom Fields, etc. 
Considering moving from **YayMail free** to [**premium plan**](https://yaycommerce.com/yaymail-woocommerce-email-customizer/)? 
See here [full comparison](https://docs.yaycommerce.com/yaymail/compare-yaymail-free-and-pro).

= Is that a one-time payment for YayMail Pro?
You can pay once to get 1 year of support and updates. When it expires, your custom email templates are intact and working. However, we recommend renewals so that you can get the latest updates and full benefits.

Shhh, we offer one-time payment and unlimited sites packages, too! [Check it out](https://yaycommerce.com/downloads/yaymail-woocommerce-email-customizer/)!
